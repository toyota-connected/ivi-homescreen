    <interface name="agl_shell" version="8">
        <description summary="user interface for Automotive Grade Linux platform">
            Starting with version 2 of the protocol, the client is required to wait
            for the 'bound_ok' or 'bound_fail' events in order to proceed further.

            In case the client gets a 'bound_fail' event then it should consider that
            there's another client already bound to the agl_shell protocol.
            A client that receives a 'bound_ok' event should consider that there's
            no other client already bound to the interface and can proceed further.

            If the client uses an older version of the protocol it will receive
            automatically an error and the compositor will terminate the connection,
            if there's another client already bound the interface.

            If the client receives the 'bound_fail' event and attempts to use the
            interface further it will receive an error and the compositor will
            terminate the connection. After the 'bound_fail' event was received the
            client should call the destructor, which has been added with version 2
            of the protocol. The client is free to try at a later point in time to
            see if it will receive the 'bound_ok' event, but there's no explicit way
            of finding out when that event will be delivered.
            It is assumed that it can infer that information through other
            means/other channels.

                This gives the client an opportunity to set up and configure several
