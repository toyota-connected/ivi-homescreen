                Tell the server that this client is ready to be shown. The server
                will delay presentation during start-up until all shell clients are
                ready to be shown, and will display a black screen instead.
                This gives the client an oppurtunity to set up and configure several
                surfaces into a coherent interface.

                The client that binds to this interface must send this request, otherwise
                they may stall the compositor unnecessarily.

                If this request is called after the compositor has already finished
                start-up, no operation is performed.

                Set the surface to act as the background of an output. After this
                request, the server will immediately send a configure event with
                the dimensions the client should use to cover the entire output.

                The surface must have a "desktop" surface role, as supported by
                libweston-desktop.

                Only a single surface may be the background for any output. If a
                background surface already exists, a protocol error is raised.

                Set the surface to act as a panel of an output. The 'edge' argument
                says what edge of the output the surface will be anchored to.
                After this request, the server will send a configure event with the
                correponding width/height that the client should use, and 0 for the
                other dimension. E.g. if the edge is 'top', the width will be the
                output's width, and the height will be 0.

                The surface must have a "desktop" surface role, as supported by
                libweston-desktop.

                The compositor will take the panel's window geometry into account when
                positioning other windows, so the panels are not covered.

                XXX: What happens if e.g. both top and left are used at the same time?
                Who gets to have the corner?

                Only a single surface may be the panel for an output's edge. If a
                surface already exists on an edge, a protocol error is raised.

                window for window management purposes.

                See xdg_toplevel.set_app_id from the xdg-shell protocol for a
                description of app_id.

                If multiple toplevels have the same app_id, the result is unspecified.
