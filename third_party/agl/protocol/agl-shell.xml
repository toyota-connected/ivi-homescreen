  <interface name="agl_shell" version="2">
    <description summary="user interface for Automotive Grade Linux platform">
      Starting with version 2 of the protocol, the client is required to wait
      for the 'bound_ok' or 'bound_fail' events in order to proceed further.

      In case the client gets a 'bound_fail' event then it should consider that
      there's another client already bound to the agl_shell protocol.
      A client that receives a 'bound_ok' event should consider that there's
      no other client already bound to the interface and can proceed further.

      If the client uses an older version of the protocol it will receive
      automatically an error and the compositor will terminate the connection,
      if there's another client already bound the interface.

      If the client receives the 'bound_fail' event and attempts to use the
      interface further it will receive an error and the compositor will
      terminate the connection. After the 'bound_fail' event was received the
      client should call the destructor, which has been added with version 2
      of the protocol. The client is free to try at a later point in time to
      see if it will receive the 'bound_ok' event, but there's no explicit way
      of finding out when that event will be delivered.
      It is assumed that it can infer that information through other
      means/other channels.

    <request name="ready">
      <description summary="client is ready to be shown">
        Tell the server that this client is ready to be shown. The server
        will delay presentation during start-up until all shell clients are
        ready to be shown, and will display a black screen instead.
        This gives the client an opportunity to set up and configure several
        surfaces into a coherent interface.

        The client that binds to this interface must send this request, otherwise
        they may stall the compositor unnecessarily.

        If this request is called after the compositor has already finished
        start-up, no operation is performed.

    <request name="set_background">
      <description summary="set surface as output's background">
        Set the surface to act as the background of an output. After this
        request, the server will immediately send a configure event with
        the dimensions the client should use to cover the entire output.

        The surface must have a "desktop" surface role, as supported by
        libweston-desktop.

        Only a single surface may be the background for any output. If a
        background surface already exists, a protocol error is raised.

    <request name="set_panel">
      <description summary="set surface as panel">
        Set the surface to act as a panel of an output. The 'edge' argument
        says what edge of the output the surface will be anchored to.
        After this request, the server will send a configure event with the
        corresponding width/height that the client should use, and 0 for the
        other dimension. E.g. if the edge is 'top', the width will be the
        output's width, and the height will be 0.

        The surface must have a "desktop" surface role, as supported by
        libweston-desktop.

        The compositor will take the panel's window geometry into account when
        positioning other windows, so the panels are not covered.

        XXX: What happens if e.g. both top and left are used at the same time?
        Who gets to have the corner?

        Only a single surface may be the panel for an output's edge. If a
        surface already exists on an edge, a protocol error is raised.

        description of app_id.

        If multiple toplevels have the same app_id, the result is unspecified.
